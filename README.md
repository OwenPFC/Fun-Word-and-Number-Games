# A Collection of Fun Word and Number Games

This collection was made in one week for the University at Buffalo Spring Game Jam.
The theme for this jam was "invert a game trope". So, we ran with the idea of turning very intelligent, calming thinking games from the New York Times, and turning them into overstimulating, overcomplicated clownlike games

I made this game with my friend [Liza](https://github.com/elysy-dev), making this my first ever collaborative project!

# The Games in the Collection

* **Sudoku:** Developed by Liza, this is your classic Sudoku puzzle... but it spins!!!! And it has Roman Numerals. Very scary stuff. For a more in depth look, please see her [Sudoku repo](https://github.com/elysy-dev/Sudoku)
